    <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this talk, I will start by discussing sample current research highlights of my lab in recent years.  Specifically, I will discuss research breakthroughs in the area of wireless sensing and perception and for applications such as imaging, crowd analytics, context inference, and smart health.  In the second part of the talk, I will reflect on my career path, share key lessons learned, and discuss tools to empower and inspire early-career researchers as they navigate their own paths.
    <p><strong>Bio:</strong> Yasamin Mostofi received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Stanford University. She is currently a professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California Santa Barbara. Yasamin is the recipient of the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), the Antonio Ruberti Prize from the IEEE Control Systems Society (research contribution award for 40 and under), the National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER award, and the IEEE Outstanding Engineer Award of Region 6 (more than 10 Western U.S. states), among other awards. She is a fellow of IEEE. She was a semi-plenary speaker at the 2018 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) and a keynote speaker at the 2018 Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation (MED). Yasamin's research is multi-disciplinary, in the two areas of wireless systems and robotics. Current high-level research thrusts include 1) RF sensing for several different applications such as through-wall imaging, occupancy analytics, context inference, smart health, and smart spaces; and 2) communication-aware robotics, UAV-assisted connectivity, and joint robotic path planning and communication. Her research has appeared in several reputable news venues such as BBC, New Scientist, Daily Mail, Engadget, TechCrunch, NSF Science360, ACM News, and IEEE Spectrum, among others. Yasamin has served in many different professional capacities over the years. Recent samples include serving on the inaugural editorial board of NPJ Wireless Technology as part of Nature Portfolio, serving on the Board of Governors of IEEE CSS, serving as a senior editor for IEEE TCNS, and serving as a program co-chair for ACM MobiCom 2022, among others. </p>
