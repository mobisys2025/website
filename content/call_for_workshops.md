ACM MobiSys is a premier venue for researchers working in the area of mobile and wireless systems, middleware, services, and applications. We solicit workshop proposals for workshops to be held in conjunction with the conference in June 2025. Workshop papers will be included with the ACM MobiSys proceedings and published in the ACM Digital Library. The duration and format of the workshop are flexible to best adapt to the audience and workshop goal.

The deadline for submitting proposals is **Februray 10th, 2025**.

## Topics of interest

We expect proposals on new and emerging topics in the general area of mobile and wireless systems, services, and applications. The ideal workshop proposal will focus on a timely and emerging topic, and be able to attract a number of interesting and high-quality contributions that spark discussions in an informal setting. The goal is to stimulate interactive conversations and inspire new research ideas. We will likely feature a mix of some returning and some new workshops.

## Submission guidelines

The proposal should be no longer than three pages and should clearly identify:

1.	Name of the workshop
2.	Name, affiliation, and contact of each organizer
3.	A brief statement of interest including a description and rationale for the workshop topic and its relevance to the ACM MobiSys community, as well as a comparison with existing workshops on related topics (if applicable)
4.	List of names and affiliations of potential program/TPC committee members

6.	Planned format of the workshop, including length of the workshop (full-day vs. half-day), the expected number of submissions and participants, a strategy to facilitate lively discussions and attendee involvement, .etc.

## Logistics

All workshops will be held together with the ACM MobiSys conference.
