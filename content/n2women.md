The {{<rawhtml>}}N<sup>2</sup>Women{{</rawhtml>}} workshop aims to foster professional networking among women in computer networking and related research fields in which women are traditionally underrepresented. Its goal is to:
- Connect newer generations of networking women researchers with the community and create mentorship relationships;
- Create a research forum in which students and junior researchers learn and discuss current trends in networking, present their research and receive feedback;
- Engage a diverse body of junior researchers in the field.

The workshop welcomes women, but also underrepresented minorities of any gender identity, students, and men who share the same research interests and face the same career hurdles.

We hope you join us for a full day of events, including talks and discussions on careers in networking, mentorship sessions, and technical sessions where, in particular, junior researchers will present their research as poster presentations.

## Call for Posters

Posters are solicited for research related to any aspect of networking and communications. All researchers in the networking and communications fields are welcome to submit their work for presentation at this workshop.

Posters will not be published and can therefore be under submission to other conferences or workshops. Authors of accepted posters will be required to present their work as part of a lightning presentation session. Presenting a poster is a great opportunity, especially for students and junior researchers, to extend the visibility of their work and to obtain interest.

The best poster will be awarded a Best Poster Award and runners-up will receive an honorable mention.

## Poster Submission

Each submission should be formatted as an extended abstract, describing the research to be presented in the poster. All submissions should be written in English with a maximum paper length of 2 printed pages including all figures and excluding references. Authors must follow the standard ACM two-column conference format with a 10-pt font size. The extended abstract must include the names, affiliations and email addresses of all authors and should be submitted as a single PDF file.

Submit your poster abstract [here](https://n2women25.hotcrp.com).
