    <h3>From Lab to Launch, from Ideas to Impacts</h3>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> After ten years of focused research, Tam Vu embarked on a new endeavor in 2018: turning his earable computing invention into a consumer product. Beyond his scientist's imagination, what followed was seven years of grit and grind until FRENZ Brainband was finally launched. Invested by Founders Fund and Samsung Ventures, FRENZ is now helping thousands of users across 37 countries sleep better.</p>
    <p>In this talk, Tam shares lessons learnt through his journey, from the initial research idea to founding Earable Neuroscience and launching FRENZ. He unpacks the challenges of translating academic research into a real-world product, and shares how the team navigated hardware design hurdles, mass manufacturing complexities, team assembly, while securing multiple funding rounds from top-tier venture capital firms. He will further share his hard-earned lessons on leadership, resilience, and the entrepreneurial mindset, highlighting differences between the lab and startup worlds.</p>
    <p>This talk offers researchers, students, and aspiring innovators practical strategies and resources to bridge the gap between laboratory research and market impact.</p>
    <p><strong>Bio:</strong> Tam Vu is the Thomas A. and Georgina Tugwell Russo 1977 Distinguished Professor of Computer Science at Dartmouth College and the Founder/CEO of Earable Neuroscience. His research in mobile and networked systems has been recognized with Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship, an NSF CAREER Award, and multiple Best Paper Awards at ACM MobiCom. Prior to Dartmouth and Earable, Tam was an Associate Professor at the University of Oxford and the University of Colorado Boulder, where he directed the Mobile and Networked Systems Lab.</p>
    <p>Tam has led Earable Neuroscience to scale to over 100 employees, raised multiple rounds from Samsung Ventures and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, and delivered thousands of products to users across 37 countries. By pushing his team to focus on consumer-centric elements such as aesthetics and fashion, he led them to win Consumer Electronics Show (CES) Innovation Awards three years in a row (2023â€“2025), as well as the Red Dot Design Award.</p>
    <p>With a vision to meaningfully improve human well-being, his current focus is to enhance human performance and extend healthspan through innovative sensing systems and AI-powered wearables.</p>
