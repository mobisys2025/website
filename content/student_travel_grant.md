ACM MobiSys 2025 is pleased to provide travel grants to support students attending the main conference and the co-located events. The purpose of this program is to encourage graduate student participation at the conference by funding the travel cost for students who would otherwise be unable to attend. Furthermore, underrepresented minorities and women students are particularly encouraged to apply.

## Eligibility

Grants are available only for full-time students attending colleges and universities in and outside the United States.

## Selection Criteria

The student’s merit qualifications, student’s statement/letter, and advisor letter(s) weigh strongly in selecting students for a travel grant. Generally, travel grants are awarded to PhD students pursuing research in areas of interest to MobiSys. We rarely consider masters students and postdocs. The factors below represent our rough prioritization.

1.	Students from under-represented groups or institutions. Additionally, grants are spread across institutions, and the historical tendency is to award one travel grant per institution.
2.	Students who authored rejected MobiSys papers.
3.	Students who have not received a prior MobiSys travel grant.
4.	Student authors of accepted papers who will not themselves be speaking at the conference.
5.	Students who are co-authors of accepted posters and/or demos.
6.	Students in early stages of their PhD studies without alternate means of support.

We also consider extenuating circumstances that are discussed in statements and letters. In addition to this, we prioritize equal representation and diversity.
