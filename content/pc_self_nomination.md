The ACM MobiSys program committee (PC) is a set of experts in mobile systems, wireless networks and mobile computing that review academic papers for publication in the ACM MobiSys 2025 program. Please fill out this form (~~https://forms.gle/gpCttBLPfvGkFd2K7~~) to apply to be a member of the ACM MobiSys 2025 PC. 

To apply, you must have:
- Published at least one full-length paper in a SIGMOBILE conference: MobiSys, MobiCom, UbiComp, MobiHoc, SenSys or SEC. 
- Have graduated with a PhD.

Applications for the MobiSys 2025 PC are due by **Friday October 4th, 2024**.

Applying does not guarantee that you will be invited to join the PC. Applying also does not commit you to join the PC -- a formal invitation will be sent to you with detailed information on PC member roles, responsibilities, PC meeting logistics and deadlines. Please note that joining the MobiSys PC is an extremely time-consuming commitment with the expectation of investing 200 or more hours. We require that all reviewers commit to draft their own high-quality reviews, submit reviews on time, participate in online discussion, PC meeting (hybrid) and potentially serve as a shepherd for accepted papers. 

Please contact the ACM MobiSys 2025 PC chairs with any questions.
