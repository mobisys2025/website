MobiSys 2025 continues the tradition of seeking proposals for posters describing novel work not published before on mobile systems, applications, and services. Posters will be presented during a specially designated session of the conference. The poster session is meant to introduce new or ongoing work and provide opportunities for authors to interact directly with conference attendees. Posters are especially suited for presenting controversial research directions that may generate discussion, or promising ideas not yet validated through extensive evaluation.

The selection of posters will be based on a short abstract, evaluated in terms of technical merit, innovation, and the potential to stimulate interesting discussions and exchange of ideas at the conference. The accepted extended abstracts will be posted on the official conference website and included in the conference proceedings and the ACM Digital Library. At least one author of an accepted poster must register for the conference and present the poster in person.
