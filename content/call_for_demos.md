MobiSys 2025 invites proposals for live demonstrations of mobile systems, applications, and services. Both research prototypes and commercial products are welcome; however, MobiSys is not suitable for marketing or sales presentations. Presenters should possess a thorough understanding of the system being demonstrated and be able to articulate its technical contributions to the audience. Unlike posters, demonstrations of previously published systems are welcome. Demos will be selected based on their anticipated interest to the MobiSys audience.

## Demo Submission Guidelines

A demo submission requires an extended abstract no longer than two 8.5x11-inch pages, including all figures and references, describing the demo. An additional page can be used to describe any special requirements (other than a demo booth/table). The extended abstract should be formatted in two columns, single-spaced, with a font no smaller than 10-point. The demo title should begin with “Demo:”. Submissions do not need to be anonymized. Please use the same LaTeX template for full papers of Mobisys 2025 for the extended abstract. Authors remain responsible for checking that their resulting PDF meets our formatting guidelines.
 
For the demo submission, it is also encouraged to submit an optional companion video that illustrates the demo. The companion video should highlight the technical contributions of the demo and should be no more than one minute long. Please include the YouTube URL of the companion video in the extended abstract.
 
The accepted extended abstracts of the demo submissions will be posted on the official conference website and will be included in the conference proceedings and the ACM Digital Library. At least one author of an accepted demo is expected to register for the conference and present the demo in person.
 
By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.
 
Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently committed to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. We are committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution, and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.
