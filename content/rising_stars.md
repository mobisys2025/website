ACM MobiSys 2025 will host the Rising Stars Forum, aimed at early career researchers, including early-stage postdoctoral researchers and PhD students, conducting research on any aspects of mobile computing, applications, and services. The forum will offer:

- A constructive environment for the Rising Stars to discuss their ongoing work with a panel of experienced researchers in the field.
- An opportunity to initiate a personal network with other Rising Stars and leading experts outside of their own research groups.


The forum will also include a panel. The panelists will also offer their experience and advice on how to carry out successful research and start a career as a researcher. The forum will be structured as a series of short in-person presentations, followed by individual discussions and feedback. Interested participants should submit a 2-page extended abstract of their work. The accepted extended abstracts will be posted on the official conference website and will be included in the conference proceedings and the ACM Digital Library. The students/postdocs who are selected to present at the Rising Stars forum must attend the forum in person, and the students will receive some priority for travel grant applications. At the forum, the chairs will invite several senior researchers from the community to serve as a mentoring committee and provide comments on the presentation of the accepted extended abstracts. The best presenters selected by the mentoring committee during the Rising Stars Forum will be invited to present their work at a separate session of the MobiSys’25 main conference.
