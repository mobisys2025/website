## Important Dates

<!-- Modify the assets/paper_important_dates.csv to modify the date -->
{{< important-date-table "paper_important_dates.csv" >}}

**Submission site:** https://mobisys25.hotcrp.com

Note that titles and abstracts submitted to register the paper by the abstract deadline, albeit not final, must be sufficiently informative, i.e. it must contain a meaningful title and a meaningful abstract of at least 100 words which will reasonably correspond to the final version of the title and the abstract. Abstracts and/or paper tiles such as "TBD", "XXX", "coming", "abcabc" or similar will be desk rejected. There will be no deadline extensions to the dates listed above.

All authors of the paper must be declared at the time of paper submission. Changes to the authorship list can only be accepted by the program chairs only if substantial reasoning is provided that the list of authors should change.

## Policy on Concurrent/Previous submissions

Papers whose contributions overlap with work currently under review elsewhere must not be submitted to ACM MobiSys 2025. Papers whose contributions overlap with an earlier published paper will be considered only if 
1. the previous paper was published (not just accepted) at a workshop before the ACM MobiSys 2025 submission date and 
2. it adds significant new contributions over the previous paper. 
Authors uncertain whether their submission meets these guidelines should contact the program chairs. Papers accompanied by non-disclosure agreement forms will not be considered. Accepted submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication; rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential.

All submissions must describe original research not published or currently under review for another conference or journal. It is [ACM policy](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions) not to allow double submissions, where the same paper is submitted concurrently to more than one conference/journal. Any double submissions detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals involved.

Posted technical reports (ArXiv or similar) do not count as prior publication. However, we encourage the authors to 
1. Use different system names in the technical report and ACM MobiSys 2025 submission and
2. Avoid publicizing the technical report on social media or community blogs and webpages while it is under review by ACM MobiSys 2025.

<h2>Resubmission Policy <span class="new">[New to MobiSys'25]</span></h2>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

If your submission was based on work that  was previously peer-reviewed and rejected, you are encouraged to provide a short summary of the points raised by the reviewers of your previous submission and how you addressed them. This non-mandatory summary can be submitted to the [submission system](https://mobisys25.hotcrp.com) and should not be part of the paper submission itself. We do not expect a full rebuttal addressing each point, but rather an indication to the reviewers of ACM MobiSys 2025 that you have taken the previous reviewers' comments seriously and are not simply resubmitting the paper as it was to ACM MobiSys 2025. The summary you have provided will be visible to the reviewers after they submitted their review to avoid any bias against paper resubmissions. 

## Double-Blind Review Process

As in the case of previous ACM MobiSys editions, ACM MobiSys 2025 will use a double-blind review policy during the initial paper review. Authors are instructed to not include their names, affiliations, and contact information on the manuscript they submit for review. Authors should also anonymize the content of their paper to hide their identity. Reviewers will not know the identity of the authors until an outcome is decided for the paper. Only program committee chairs will know the identity of the authors and be able to interact with them during the review process, should the need arise. Submissions which are not properly anonymized will be rejected without being reviewed.

Submissions will be judged on originality, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and technical correctness. Papers may be conditionally accepted and shepherded by a member of the program committee, with final acceptance determined by consent of the shepherd.

## Formatting Guidelines

Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (PDF). We will not accept papers in any other format. Any papers that do not adhere to the following guidelines may be rejected without review:

1. Contain no more than twelve (12) single-spaced and numbered pages, including figures, tables, any appendices, and any other material, followed by as many pages as necessary for bibliographic references. Papers whose non-bibliographic content is longer than 12 pages will not be reviewed.
2. Font size no smaller than 10 points.
3. Double column format with each column having dimensions 9.25 inches x 3.33 inches, a space of 0.33 inches between the two columns, and with no more than 55 lines of text per column.
4. Fit properly on US letter-sized paper (8.5 inches by 11 inches).
5. Again, submissions must be in PDF. Authors should ensure that they are compatible with Adobe Acrobat (English version). Any other formats, including Postscript and MS-Word, will not be accepted.
6. Authors’ names must not appear anywhere in the paper or in the PDF file. The PDF file must also not contain any embedded hyperlinks, as these may compromise reviewer anonymity.
7. Limit the file size to less than 15 MB: please contact the Program Committee chairs if you have a file larger than this limit.
8. You may find these [templates](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) useful in complying with the above requirements. For LaTex users, please use `\documentclass[sigconf,10pt]{acmart}`. But as an author, you bear the final responsibility to verify that your submission is format-compliant.

## Ethics Review Board Approval Requirement

As part of the submission process, authors of papers that describe experiments on human subjects, or that analyze non-public data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), will be asked to certify that their work was vetted by an ethics review (e.g., Institutional Review Board (IRB), Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) or similar approval). We expect authors to follow the rules of their host institutions around data collection and experiments with human subjects. Papers that will not adhere to this rule will be rejected.

## Mandatory Registration

At least one author of an accepted paper is expected to register for the ACM MobiSys 2025 conference (at a non-student rate) and present the paper in-person.

## Artifact Evaluation and Paper Results Reproducibility

As in the case of previous two ACM MobiSys editions, the authors of accepted ACM MobiSys 2025 papers will have the option to opt for an artifact evaluation. By doing so, they commit to providing the implementations, models, test suites, benchmarks, and data used to derive the results presented in the paper to the artifact evaluation committee. Based on the evaluation, the papers will be awarded the appropriate artifact evaluation badgelink: https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging. The artifact evaluation will be conducted after paper acceptance decisions.

Irrespective of taking part in the artifact evaluation, we encourage all authors to do their best to provide enough information in the paper allowing non-authors to replicate results presented in the paper.

## Early Rejection Notification and Rebuttal

ACM MobiSys 2025 will have early rejection notifications and a rebuttal phase. The authors of the papers that do not advance to the second round of review will be notified of the rejection of their paper. This allows the authors to plan for another submission and not have to wait for the ACM MobiSys 2025 review process to come to an end. The papers that do advance to the second round of review will get a chance to submit a rebuttal after the second round comes to an end. In the rebuttal, the authors will be asked to respond to the questions raised by the reviewers. 

We ask the authors to limit their responses to correcting factual errors in the reviews or responding to specific questions posed by the reviewers. Responses must not include new experiments or describe additional work completed since submission. To lower the amount of effort for both the authors and reviewers, ACM MobiSys 2025 limits the rebuttal to 500 words.


## Conflict of Interest

To ensure a fair review process, PC members who have a conflict of interest with any author of the submission will not review or participate in the discussion of the submission. It is the author’s responsibility to mark conflict of interests in the submission website.

ACM MobiSys 2025 will follow the [ACM policy](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest) and also add and extend rules on the specific relationships to explicitly define conflicts of interest of one submission as:

1. any program committee member who works/worked at the same organizational affiliation with any co-author in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months;
2. any program committee member who has co-authored any book, article, report, abstract or paper with collaboration in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months;
3. any program committee member who has collaborated on projects, such as funded grants, research or others with any co-author in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months;
4. any program committee member who is/was the advisor or advisee of any co-author; These include your BSc advisor(s), Msc advisor(s), PhD advisor(s) and/or postdoctoral host(s).
5. any program committee member who graduated from the same research group and/or was under the same advisor/supervisor/manager in the last 48 months;
6. any program committee member who is exposed to the full or partial authorship of the work being submitted here in any public or private channel (including but not limited to interview talks, campus visits, research discussion, conversations);
7. any program committee member who has family, marriage, blood or heritage relationships.
8. any program committee member who has a close personal friendship or business relationship beyond professional settings that could affect the review process with any co-author;
9. others perceivable conflicts.

Cases that do not require conflict of interest notification include:

1. Reviewers that are working on the same topic as you.
2. Collaborations with the reviewers on program committees, open source projects, etc.

A potential conflict of interest must be identified at the submission and can be updated at any point during the review process, but when possible, potential conflicts should be determined before acceptance decisions are made.

The author(s) must identify every conflict of interest out of all program committee members (including chairs) with any author of the submission and indicate the type of conflict during the submission process. For other forms of conflicts (item 8), the authors must contact the program chairs and explain the perceived conflict.

Knowingly hiding or falsifying a stated conflict of interest, and knowingly and falsely asserting a conflict of interest, e.g., to prevent or alter peer-reviewing, to discourage appropriate reviewing, or to seek disadvantage of another are both considered as a violation of this conflict of interest policy. We will return the violated submissions with no reviews. Please contact program committee chairs if you have any doubts regarding declaring conflicts of interest.

<h2>Pitch Video for Accepted Papers <span class="new">[New to MobiSys'25]</span></h2>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

All accepted ACM MobiSys 2025 papers will be asked to submit, together with a camera-ready version of their paper, a (approximately) 90 seconds video presenting their accepted project. The submitted video will be part of ACM MobiSys 2025 proceedings and added to the SIGMOBILE YouTube Channel.

<h2>Policy on the Use of Large Language Models <span class="new">[New to MobiSys'25]</span></h2>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

Following other major conferences such as [CHI 2025](https://chi2025.acm.org/for-authors/papers/), any text in submissions that is generated using large-scale language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly identified by the authors in the submitted paper. This policy does not apply to using LLMs for editing/proof-reading the author’s own text. Please carefully review the [April 2023 ACM Policy on Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship) before you use these tools. While we do not anticipate using tools at a large scale to identify LLM-generated text, we will thoroughly investigate submissions brought to our attention and desk reject papers where LLM use is not clearly marked.
