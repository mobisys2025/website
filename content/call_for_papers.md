Note that titles and abstracts submitted to register the paper by the abstract deadline, albeit not final, must be sufficiently informative.

## Policy on Concurrent/Previous submissions

Papers whose contributions overlap with work currently under review elsewhere must not be submitted to ACM MobiSys. Papers whose contributions overlap with an earlier published paper will be considered only if (1) the previous paper was published (not just accepted) at a workshop at least 6 months before the ACM MobiSys submission date and (2) it adds significant new contributions over the previous paper. Authors uncertain whether their submission meets these guidelines should contact the program chairs. Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered. Accepted submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication; rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential.

All submissions must describe original research not published or currently under review for another conference or journal. It is ACM policy ([ACM Author Rights and Publishing Policy, Prior Publication, and Simultaneous Submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/publication-rights-and-licensing-policy)) not to allow double submissions, where the same paper is submitted concurrently to more than one conference/journal. Any double submissions detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals involved.

Posted technical reports (ArXiv or similar) do not count as prior publication. However, we encourage the authors to (1) use different system names in the technical report and MobiSys submission and (2) avoid publicizing the technical report on social media or community blogs and webpages while it is under review by MobiSys.

## Double-Blind Review Process

ACM MobiSys will use a double-blind review policy during the initial paper review. Authors are instructed to not include their names, affiliations, and contact information on the manuscript they submit for review. Authors should also anonymize the content of their paper to hide their identity. Reviewers will not know the identity of the authors until an outcome is decided for the paper. Only PC chairs will know the identity of the authors and be able to interact with them during the review process, should the need arise. Submissions which are not properly anonymized will be rejected without being reviewed.

Submissions will be judged on originality, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and technical correctness. Papers may be conditionally accepted and shepherded by a member of the program committee, with final acceptance determined by consent of the shepherd.

## Formatting Guidelines

Submissions must be in PDF. We will not accept papers in any other format. Any papers that do not adhere to the following guidelines may be rejected without review:

- Contain no more than twelve (12) single-spaced and numbered pages, including figures, tables, any appendices, and any other material, followed by as many pages as necessary for bibliographic references. Papers whose non-bibliographic content is longer than 12 pages will not be reviewed.
- Font size no smaller than 10 points.
- Double column format with each column having dimensions 9.25 inches x 3.33 inches, a space of 0.33 inches between the two columns, and with no more than 55 lines of text per column.
- Fit properly on US letter-sized paper (8.5 inches by 11 inches).
- Submissions must be in PDF (Portable Document Format) authors should ensure that they are compatible with Adobe Acrobat (English version). - Any other formats, including Postscript and MS-Word, will not be accepted.
- Authors’ names must not appear anywhere in the paper or in the PDF file. The PDF file must also not contain any embedded hyperlinks, as these may compromise reviewer anonymity.
- Limit the file size to less than 15 MB: contact the PC chairs if you have a file larger than this limit.

You may find these [templates](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) useful in complying with the above requirements. For Latex users, please use \documentclass[sigconf,10pt]{acmart}. But as an author, you bear the final responsibility to verify that your submission is format compliant.

## IRB Approval Requirement

As part of the submission process, authors of papers that describe experiments on human subjects, or that analyze nonpublic data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), will be asked to certify that their work was vetted by an ethics review (e.g., IRB approval). We expect authors to follow the rules of their host institutions around data collection and experiments with human subjects.

## Mandatory Registration

At least one author of an accepted paper is expected to register for the conference (at non-student rate) and present the paper in-person.

## Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers

The authors of accepted MobiSys’25 papers will have the option to opt for an artifact evaluation. By doing so, they commit to providing the implementations, models, test suites, benchmarks, and data used to derive the results presented in the paper to the artifact evaluation committee. Based on the evaluation, the papers will be awarded the appropriate artifact evaluation badge https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging. The artifact evaluation will be conducted after paper acceptance decisions.

## Early Rejection Notification and Rebuttal

MobiSys’25 will have early rejection notifications and a rebuttal phase. The authors of the papers that do not advance to the second round of review will be notified of the rejection of their paper. This allows the authors to plan for another submission and not have to wait for the MobiSys review process to come to an end. The papers that do advance to the second round of review will get a chance to submit a rebuttal after the second round comes to an end. In the rebuttal, the authors will be asked to respond to the questions raised by the reviewers. We ask the authors to limit their responses to correcting factual errors in the reviews or responding to specific questions posed by the reviewers. Responses must not include new experiments or describe additional work completed since submission. To lower the amount of effort for both the authors and reviewers, MobiSys limits the rebuttal to 500 words.

## Conflict of Interest

To ensure a fair review process, PC members who have a conflict of interest with any author of the submission will not review or participate in the discussion of the submission. It is the author’s responsibility to mark conflict of interests in the submission website.
We generally follow the ACM policy ([Conflict of Interest Policy for ACM Publications](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest)) and also add and extend rules on the specific relationships to explicitly define conflicts of interest of one submission as:

1.  any PC member who works/worked at the same organizational affiliation with any co-author in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months;
2. any PC member who has co-authored any book, article, report, abstract or paper with collaboration in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months;
3. any PC member who has collaborated on projects, such as funded grants, research or others with any co-author in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months;
4. any PC member who is/was the advisor or advisee of any co-author;
5. any PC member who graduated from the same research group and/or was under the same advisor/supervisor/manager in the last 48 months;
6. any PC member who is exposed to the full or partial authorship of the work being submitted here in any public or private channel (including but not limited to interview talks, campus visits, research discussion, conversations);
7. any PC member who has a close personal friendship or business relationship beyond professional settings that could affect the review process with any co-author;
8. others perceivable conflicts.

A potential conflict of interest must be identified at the submission and can be updated at any point during the review process, but when possible, potential conflicts should be determined before acceptance decisions are made.

The author(s) must identify every conflict of interest out of all PC members (including chairs) with any author of the submission and indicate the type of conflict during the submission process. For other forms of conflicts (item 8), the authors must contact the program chairs and explain the perceived conflict.

Knowingly hiding or falsifying a stated conflict of interest, and knowingly and falsely asserting a conflict of interest ? e.g., to prevent or alter peer-reviewing, to discourage appropriate reviewing, or to seek disadvantage of another ? are both considered as a violation of this conflict of interest policy. We will return the violated submissions with no reviews.
